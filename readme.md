Usage
=====

d3rrc is designed to work with browserify.  It can also be used as a stand alone
javascript file (just download the build.js file and include it in your project).

If you use the build.js file know that it includes the supported version of
React/Addons, D3, and all of the support libraries utilized.

Feel free to create your own custom build.
